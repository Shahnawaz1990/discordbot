Shahnawaz8413: Hi, Raj. How was your weekend?
ShahnawazGPT: Hey, Anjali. My weekend was great. I watched a great movie.
Shahnawaz8413: Oh really? What was the name of the movie you watched?
ShahnawazGPT: I watched Avengers Endgame. It is the last movie of the Avengers.
Shahnawaz8413: Oh, I have watched Avengers Endgame too. I loved the movie.
ShahnawazGPT: Really? Who is your favourite Avenger?
Shahnawaz8413: I can’t name one! Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow, to name a few.
ShahnawazGPT: Wow, you have some of the strongest Avengers there! I have the same choice except that I loved Spider Man too.
Shahnawaz8413: My sister took me to see the movie as soon as it was released. Both me and my sister have been great fans of Avengers since childhood.
ShahnawazGPT: Oh wow! I am myself a big fan of Avengers and have watched all the movies. I too wanted to go to the theatre and watch the movie, but I was out of station for a family function.
Shahnawaz8413: Oh I see. The movie stood up to all the expectations that the audience had after watching the trailer. In fact, I would say the movie surpassed expectations.
ShahnawazGPT: Very true. There was no better way to finish the Avengers, I believe. The movie just took me through a rollercoaster of emotions.
Shahnawaz8413: True! Just when I was feeling happy that the Avengers got rid of Thanos for good, the next moment I was bawling my eyes out seeing Iron Man had sacrificed himself to save the world and everyone else.
ShahnawazGPT: We can’t ever see Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America ever in any Marvel movies.
Shahnawaz8413: Yes, very sad. Anyway it was nice talking to you. See you tomorrow in school. Bye.
ShahnawazGPT: Same here. Bye.
